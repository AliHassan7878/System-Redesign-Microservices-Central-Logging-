# System Redesign with Microservices and Central Logging

## Overview
Redesigned the system architecture by integrating microservices and central logging to achieve scalable, maintainable, and robust application infrastructure. Led the project from planning to implementation and validation.

## Features
- Microservices architecture for modular and scalable services.  
- Centralized logging for easier monitoring and debugging.  
- RESTful APIs for service-to-service communication.  

## Technologies
- Python, Flask (backend and API development)  
- Docker (containerization)  
- MariaDB (database management)  
- Logging and monitoring tools (centralized logging)  

## My Role
- Conducted system analysis and designed a microservices-based architecture.
- Migrated the entire system to a containerized environment, creating dedicated Docker containers for each application to improve scalability, maintainability, and deployment efficiency. 
- Developed backend services and integrated centralized logging.  
- Managed testing, deployment, and documentation for team understanding.  

## Results
- Improved system scalability, maintainability, and monitoring.  
- Enabled teams to deploy and debug services efficiently.
